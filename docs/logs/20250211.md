## File-based storage

Initially, the goal is to fetch and the store the historical prices for some 
small number of stocks, e.g. those in S&P500.

The data flow involves:

- Fetching the initial price data, from earlier date to today (T)
  - These files can be named as `AAPL/00010101_20250211.csv`
- Have an audit system that can verify and report on the completeness of the
  stored data, e.g. that `AAPL/00010101_20250211.csv` should contain data
  up to 2025/02/11
- Then, periodically, fetch new data, e.g. by first scanning the existing files
  and determine the latest date that the data is available
- Overtime, merge files together based on today

So the simple solution looks like an Append-only log.
