## Async on Docker

When running Async and using `Async.Log`, it requires a source of time. On Docker, `/etc/localtime` is missing, and requires manual fix.

e.g. from https://github.com/apache/incubator-graphar/issues/502:

> Resolution Steps:

1. Install the IANA time zone database:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install tzdata
  ```

2. Set the environment variable TZDIR to point to the location of the IANA time zone database:

```
export TZDIR=/usr/share/zoneinfo
```
