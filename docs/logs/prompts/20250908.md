## Adding an Orders module

- Add an orders module to `./trading/trading/orders`
- Overall, maintain a similar structure and style (e.g. choice of shared
  libraries) with other modules in the project
- There are two (or three) aspects of it (could be two submodules?)
  0. Defining the order type (and necessary types)
  1. Managing the orders in a CRUD fashion
    - e.g. adding / removing / listing orders. Imagine this is a client of a
      broker backend where we submit / cancel orders to our broker / brokeage
      account. A prior attempt of similar spirit can be found at
      https://github.com/dayfine/trading/pull/42/files
  2. Helpers / factories to construct different types of orders, e.g. market vs.
     stop vs. stop limit / long vs. short
     - Which can be given to the managers for submission
