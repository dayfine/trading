# TA

## Installing

1. Download for ARM64 from https://ta-lib.org/install/
2. Copy into Docker container using:
    ```sh
    # Find the container
    $ docker container ls
    ```

    ```sh
    $ docker cp <src-path> <container>:<dest-path>
    ```

## TA Integration

### CType Stub

According to https://dev.realworldocaml.org/foreign-function-interface.html, `ctypes-cstubs` is the way to go. Let `Cursor` figured out how to do all that by following the example in https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/foreign-code.html.

### TA testing

Cursor followed https://ta-lib.org/api/#direct_call to write the application code, but made a mistake in parameter ordering. That resulted in very unclear error messages as at C level it's simply a value error, and there is no clear error message.
