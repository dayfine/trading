;; CAPACITY VALIDATION ONLY — NOT A STRATEGY VALIDATION
;;
;; This scenario exists to measure peak RSS, wall, and engine stability
;; over a 30-year horizon at N=1000. The universe
;; (`universes/broad-1000-30y.sexp`) is intrinsically survivorship-
;; biased: every symbol was selected because it survived from <=1996 to
;; 2026. Returns and drawdowns over a 30y backtest on this cohort do NOT
;; reflect what the strategy would have produced live. See
;; `dev/notes/historical-universe-membership-2026-04-30.md` for the
;; bias caveat (issue #696) and
;; `dev/notes/n1000-30y-capacity-2026-04-30.md` for the run output.
;;
;; Do NOT add this cell to tier-3 or tier-4 perf workflows. Do NOT
;; compare its return/drawdown to "expected" values. The expected
;; ranges below are intentionally wide because they are not a baseline
;; — they exist solely to gate "did the run complete without crashing,
;; OOMing, or producing nonsense like NaN drawdown".
;;
;; enable_short_side = false (mirror of #682's mitigation): the
;; short-side gaps documented in `dev/notes/short-side-gaps-2026-04-29.md`
;; (G1-G4) produce broken metrics on any scenario crossing a Bearish-
;; macro window. G4 not yet merged at scenario-creation time, so long-
;; only is the safe default for any new long-horizon cell.
;;
;; Cost-model projection (post-engine-pool):
;;   RSS ≈ 67 + 3.94·N + 0.19·N·(T−1)
;;        = 67 + 3940 + 0.19·1000·29
;;        = ~9,517 MB (~9.3 GB).
;; Measured-vs-projected gap on N=1000×10y was 52 % (2,945 MB measured
;; vs 5,700 MB projected; see dev/notes/n1000-decade-rss-2026-04-29.md).
;; If the same factor holds, expect ~5 GB peak. Won't fit GHA 8 GB
;; ceiling under the cost-model worst case — runs locally on
;; trading-1-dev (32 GB host) only.
