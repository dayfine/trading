# Status: sector-data

## Last updated: 2026-04-15

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

Item 1 merged (#349), Items 2-3 pending.

## Ownership
`ops-data` agent — see `.claude/agents/ops-data.md`. Scope is data
infrastructure (fetch script, parser, output CSV). The `Sector_map`
OCaml loader already exists at
`trading/analysis/weinstein/data_source/lib/sector_map.{ml,mli}` and
consumes `data/sectors.csv` — it is format-agnostic and works with any
row count, so no feature-code work is required to absorb a larger file.

## Interface stable
YES

Output file schema is fixed: `data/sectors.csv` with header
`symbol,sector` and GICS sector names. New fetcher must write this exact
schema so `Sector_map.load` keeps working unchanged.

## Blocked on
- None.

## Problem

Current `data/sectors.csv` = **1,654 symbols** (static, pre-committed, no
fetcher code in the repo). This caps the backtest universe at 1,654 since
`runner.ml:89-91` derives the universe from `Hashtbl.keys ticker_sectors`.
Total EODHD inventory is 24,529 instruments; the active target is
~5,000–8,000 common-stock tickers with sector tags.

Prior attempt — `dev/notes/sector-data-plan.md` §SSGA — validated a
holdings-file fetcher (Phase 0 done 2026-04-11) but only covers ~492
S&P 500 names. Insufficient for this goal. SSGA remains a potential
authoritative source for S&P 500 sector labels in a later validation
pass but is not the primary coverage path.

## Chosen approach — Finviz scrape

Finviz (`finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=<SYM>`) serves a compact stats table
per ticker that includes `Sector`, `Industry`, and `Country`. Historical
layout is stable enough for a one-shot HTML scrape. Coverage for
US-listed common stocks: ~8,000 names at 1 req/sec → ~2.2 hours
one-shot. No auth required. Terms-of-service grey area acceptable for
internal, non-redistributed use.

### Why Finviz over alternatives

| Source | Coverage | Cost | Integration effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Finviz** (chosen) | ~8,000 US common stocks | free | HTML scrape (~250 lines OCaml) |
| SSGA holdings | ~492 (S&P 500) | free | XLSX parser (~200 lines) — in the repo plan but coverage too narrow |
| EODHD fundamentals | full 24k inventory | $59.99/mo | one API call per symbol, standard JSON |
| Yahoo summaryProfile | varies, flaky | free | scraping, rate-limited |

Finviz is the only free option that covers the desired scope. Paid
EODHD stays available as a drop-in upgrade if Finviz becomes unstable.

## Completed
- Phase 0 validation on SSGA (2026-04-11) — confirmed the XLSX
  endpoint works but limited coverage. Kept as a backup source.
- Existing `Sector_map.load` handles arbitrary-sized `sectors.csv`.
- **Item 1 — `fetch_finviz_sectors.exe`** (2026-04-15) — implemented
  and tested. 7 files, ~250 lines OCaml + ~170 lines tests. Uses
  `cohttp-async` + `re` (regex) for HTML parsing. Builds and all 10
  unit tests pass. Branch: `ops/sector-finviz-scraper`.

## In Progress
- None — waiting for Item 1 PR merge before Item 2 (one-shot run).

## Next Steps (work items — ops-data)

### Item 1 — `fetch_finviz_sectors.exe`

Scope: `trading/analysis/scripts/fetch_finviz_sectors/`.

- Reads the universe list (default: `data/universe.sexp` — all 24,529,
  filtered to Common Stock) and fetches `finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=<SYM>`
  per ticker.
- Rate-limits at 1 req/sec (configurable via `--rate-limit`).
- Uses `cohttp-lwt-unix` with a benign `Mozilla/5.0` User-Agent and
  redirect-following.
- Parser extracts `Sector` cell from the snapshot table. Use `lambdasoup`
  (already available) or a small regex — the table is server-rendered
  HTML, not JS-rendered.
- Writes `data/sectors.csv` (header `symbol,sector`) atomically via a
  tempfile + rename. Also writes `data/sectors.csv.manifest` (sexp):
  `{ fetched_at; source = "finviz"; row_count; rate_limit_rps; errors }`.
- Idempotent resume: if the manifest is fresh (<30 days old) and a
  symbol already has a row, skip it unless `--force`.
- Graceful degradation: on HTTP errors for a single symbol, log + skip;
  continue the batch. Success criterion: ≥80% of symbols parsed.

Estimate: ~250 lines OCaml + ~40 lines dune/tests.

### Item 2 — one-shot run + commit the expanded file

- Run the fetcher against the current universe.
- Target: 5,000+ symbols with valid sector assignments.
- Commit resulting `data/sectors.csv` + `data/sectors.csv.manifest`.
- Run the existing backtest smoke test to confirm universe size bumps
  from 1,654 to ≥5,000 and nothing breaks downstream.

### Item 3 — refresh cadence hook

- Update `.claude/agents/ops-data.md` preflight: read
  `data/sectors.csv.manifest` at session start; warn + offer refresh if
  `fetched_at` is more than 30 days stale.

Estimate: ~20 lines of agent-def edits.

### Item 4 — universe composition cleanup (drop mutual funds + noise)

The current universe (derived from `sectors.csv` keys) carries symbols
the Weinstein strategy will never trade: mutual funds (no intraday
bars), extremely-low-volume ETFs (won't pass the volume filter
anyway), ADRs / preferreds / warrants / units that are noise for a
stage-analysis strategy. They inflate fetch / memory budgets and slow
every simulation step linearly.

Scope:
- New `trading/analysis/scripts/universe_filter/universe_filter.ml`:
  pure function `filter : Instrument_info.t list -> Instrument_info.t list`
  applying rules by instrument type + exchange + symbol suffix +
  (optional) average dollar-volume threshold.
- Rule set (configurable, not hardcoded):
  - Drop instrument types containing "Mutual Fund" / "Open-End Fund"
  - Drop symbols matching patterns already in
    `_is_likely_etf_or_index` in `fetch_finviz_sectors_lib` (suffixes
    `.INDX`, `W`, `WS`, `-P*`, `.U`). Reuse or factor out shared logic.
  - Optional: drop symbols with `avg_dollar_volume < $1M/day` when the
    bars cache has enough history to compute it.
- Wire into the `sectors.csv` rebuild path: filter the universe list
  *before* passing it to the scraper, so we don't spend 1 req/sec on
  tickers we'll throw away.
- Hand-picked ETF allow-list kept outside the filter (SPY, QQQ, XL*
  sector ETFs, a few large VTI/VOO/QQQ variants) so we don't lose the
  sector-ETF inputs the strategy needs.

Estimate: ~200 lines OCaml + ~60 lines tests + universe regen.

Acceptance: rerunning the Finviz scraper on the filtered universe
yields fewer errors (no more of the OTC "A*" junk that can't parse)
and the resulting `sectors.csv` is smaller but still ≥5,000 rows of
real common stock + ETFs.

## Not in scope
- `Sector_map` loader changes — already works generically.
- Weinstein strategy wiring — already consumes `ticker_sectors` via
  `runner.ml` and `Macro_inputs.build_sector_map`.
- Paid EODHD upgrade — available as a fallback but not the chosen path.
- SSGA XLSX fetcher — superseded by Finviz for coverage reasons; kept
  optional for S&P 500 validation cross-check.

## QC
overall_qc: NOT_STARTED
structural_qc: NOT_STARTED
behavioral_qc: NOT_STARTED

Reviewers when work lands:
- qc-structural — HTTP client patterns, error handling, atomic file
  write, idempotency.
- qc-behavioral — manual spot-check on 20-30 random sector assignments
  vs authoritative source (e.g. SSGA holdings, Yahoo profile). Assert
  coverage goal (≥5,000 rows) and no schema drift in `sectors.csv`.
