# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-06-15 (orchestrator run 27581855737 [run 5]: NO feat-dispatch (5th consecutive no-dispatch run today). Main GREEN on 3f931e13 (all required CI checks SUCCESS). The LOCAL maintainer session landed the whole locked-priority cluster overnight: factor-lens 5b (#1607), 28y WF-CV robustness (#1605), margin Phase-1 sizing_cash seam (#1606), deep health scan (#1603), weekly-snapshot C2 test (#1596). Reconciled rows: weekly-snapshot (#1596 merged → PR cell cleared), rolling-start-lens (5b cols #1607 done → next causal analysis), short-side (#1606 seam landed → next Phase-5 re-pin, human-gated). Remaining active work all LOCAL/in-flight or gated: factor-lens causal analysis data-gated on a LOCAL overnight matrix re-run (ETA ~01:00, container /tmp); WF-CV per-fold rolling-membership follow-up data-gated; margin Phase-5 + short-side human-gated (re-pins goldens). Open PRs #1604 (LOCAL maintainer harness, CI green — not orchestrator's to merge) + #1601 (automated opam chore). Health CLEAN (status-integrity + index-size linters exit 0). 0 subagents. [run 4]: NO feat-dispatch — drained; only #1600 (run-3 summary) merged. [run 3]: NO feat-dispatch; #1594/#1598/#1599 merged (dayfine local). [run 2]: NO feat-dispatch; #1589/#1593/#1595 merged, ci-red #1591 closed. [run 1]: RED-MAIN RECOVERY — disk-exhaustion flake cleared via #1590.)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
