# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-06-13 (orchestrator run 27461622165 [run 2]: QC'd maintainer PR #1560 short-side suppression — APPROVED both gates (quality 5), but maintainer self-merged it at 08:50Z mid-review; verdict agrees. Maintainer also merged #1558 (fold-health runner wiring, prior file-length blocker resolved) + #1561 (warmup-suppression WF-CV REJECTS the flip — P0 warmup escalation resolved). Main GREEN on a849bf26 (build+runtest exit 0). 0 open PRs, 0 ci-red issues.)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
