# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-06-15 (orchestrator run 27527290125 [run 2]: NO feat-dispatch — GHA-eligible surface still drained. Main GREEN on cb1fb59d (#1589/#1593/#1595 merged since run 1; ci-red #1591 now closed). Two open PRs are LOCAL maintainer (dayfine) work — #1596 weekly-snapshot C2 test, #1594 eligible-universe builder — fenced per gha-local-coordination.md (do not QC/merge). Reconciled their rows. Health CLEAN (linters exit 0). 0 subagents. [run 1]: NO feat-dispatch — RED-MAIN RECOVERY + reconcile. Main was RED on a05d9479 (#1588) from a CI-infra disk-exhaustion flake (`dune_trace_write(): No space left on device` during link; no linter/test FAIL; #1588 PR-branch CI was green on cd87d217). Token can't rerun jobs (403), so cleared it by squash-merging the CI-green, mergeable run-4 summary PR #1590 → fresh main CI on 567d7760 (build-and-test re-run on a clean runner) → GREEN; closed ci-red #1591. Reconciled data-foundations row to show the in-flight LOCAL maintainer PR #1589 (Thread-1 volume enrichment). No GHA-eligible non-gated work remained (grill roadmap routed all but Initiative A — shipped run-4 #1588 — to the LOCAL session). 2026-06-14 [run 4]: 1 DISPATCH → AUTO-MERGED #1588 (weekly-snapshot M6.6 generator / Initiative A). [run 3]: reconciled #1582 cash-floor NS1 flip. [run 1]: #1574 sweep-perf, #1575 cash-floor NS3.)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
