# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Update when a status file flips
state, an owner changes, or a PR opens / merges / closes. Keep the table
terse; detail belongs in the per-track status files linked in column 1.

Last updated: 2026-04-19 (run-2 reconcile: #434/#435/#436 still awaiting merge; stacked #438 + new #439 opened and NEEDS_REWORK)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

| Track | Status | Owner | Open PR(s) | Next task |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [backtest-infra](backtest-infra.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#419 per-phase tracing merged 2026-04-19) |
| [backtest-scale](backtest-scale.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | feat-backtest | #434, #438 | #434 (3a) QC APPROVED awaiting human merge. Stacked #438 (3b Summary tier) NEEDS_REWORK (behavioral, quality 3) — `rs_line` feeds daily bars to `Relative_strength.analyze`, must aggregate to weekly first; next run reworks + re-QCs. |
| [support-floor-stops](support-floor-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (PRs #382 primitive + #390 wiring both merged 2026-04-17) |
| [short-side-strategy](short-side-strategy.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#420 merged 2026-04-19). Follow-ups carried to own tracks: bear-window backtest regression, full short cascade, Ch.11 behavioural spot-check. |
| [strategy-wiring](strategy-wiring.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#408 + #409 both merged 2026-04-18) |
| [sector-data](sector-data.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | ops-data | #436 | Item 3 (ops-data manifest preflight) implemented — awaiting human merge; track closes to MERGED on merge. GHA runs still use `trading/test_data/sectors.csv`. |
| [harness](harness.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | harness-maintainer | #435, #439 | #435 (Check 11 linter-exception expiry) QC APPROVED awaiting human merge. #439 (stale local jj bookmarks) NEEDS_REWORK (structural) — header count not bumped ten→eleven and also collides with #435 on "Check 11"; whoever merges second renumbers. Next after #439 reworked: T3-A+ (move deep-scan to weekly cron; retire inline fast-scan). |
| [orchestrator-automation](orchestrator-automation.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-adjacent | — | Phase 1 live (daily cron runs producing summary PRs). Phase 2 (background execution for scrapers, golden re-runs, cross-feature QC) pending empirical tests per status file. |
| [data-layer](data-layer.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |
| [portfolio-stops](portfolio-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |
| [screener](screener.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |
| [simulation](simulation.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
