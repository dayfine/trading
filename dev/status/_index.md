# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-08-24 (orchestrator run 32702560562; main `2b11c60d` ->
`90455866`). **Queue empty again at start** — zero open PRs, so the Step 0.5
fast-exit was correctly declined on its own A-FASTEXIT-VACUOUS precondition for
the second run running. Three tracks dispatched, three PRs opened, **two merged**
(**#2504**, **#2507**); **#2505** is held by a stale QC rule (#2508).

**The finding worth carrying: all three of #2503's named suspects are cleared at
the code level.** #2503 (P1, filed 06:29Z today) reports main's default path
changed — same config, same warehouse, 305.25 -> 243.06 return, divergent entered
symbol set from the first weeks of 2000. Two differential harnesses were built
against the merge-bases and both came back byte-identical: **#2505** cleared
#2492's `Stop_geometry` extraction over **4,968 public-API calls** (`cmp` exit 0,
md5 `ef99e0c1...`), and **#2507** cleared #2500 + #2501 over the selection path at
three commits (`cmp` exit 0 on all three pairs). **The leading remaining
hypothesis is baseline provenance** — the funding-grid run committed no
`params.sexp`, so its `code_version` is *inferred, not recorded*, and the
"verbatim config clone" may be compared against a run from a different commit.
#2503's own bisect plan anticipates this. **Do not spend container time
re-auditing the stops.**

**Both differentials now land as permanent `runtest` pins**, so this class of
question is answerable by CI rather than by a multi-hour bisect.

**Governance finding — qc-structural's A2 row is factually stale (issue #2508).**
It allow-lists `analysis/` -> `trading/trading/` imports only under `backtest/**`,
but 16 non-backtest dirs already declare `weinstein.*`, and the row as written
would **FAIL main itself** on `types` and `indicators.*`. It produced a false A2
FAIL on #2505. **Deliberately filed, not fixed:** `.claude/rules/**` is
permission-protected, and amending the QC authority to clear a FAIL on this run's
own PR is a conflict of interest a human should adjudicate.

**Audit defect, corrected by hand (issue #2509).** `record_qc_audit.sh` file mode
inverts verdicts on any *reworked* PR: #2504 merged with both gates APPROVED and
was recorded `NEEDS_REWORK`. Positional "first/last `## Verdict`" extraction
breaks once a review file holds two passes. Sibling of last run's
`A-AUDIT-REWORK-SHA-STALE` — the `sha` field is now correct; the verdict is not.

Per-run history lives in `dev/daily/YYYY-MM-DD*.md`, one file per
orchestrator run — not here. This header carries the current run only.
Ten prior run summaries were inlined above it until 2026-08-14, growing
the file to 21,972 bytes against the linter's 20,480 cap and turning a
lookup table into a changelog; each already ended with a pointer to its
own daily file, so nothing was lost in moving them out. Recent runs:
`2026-08-14.md`, `2026-08-13.md`, `2026-08-12.md`, `2026-08-09.md`,
`2026-08-08.md`, `2026-08-07.md`, `2026-08-05.md`, `2026-08-04.md`.

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
