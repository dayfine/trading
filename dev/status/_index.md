# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Update when a status file flips
state, an owner changes, or a PR opens / merges / closes. Keep the table
terse; detail belongs in the per-track status files linked in column 1.

Last updated: 2026-04-19 (run-4 reconcile: #434, #435, #436, #439, #444, #445, #446 all merged since run-3; #438 closed (split into #444+#445); #447 3c-Full-tier and #448 harness-retire-fast-scan dispatched this run)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

| Track | Status | Owner | Open PR(s) | Next task |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [backtest-infra](backtest-infra.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#419 per-phase tracing merged 2026-04-19) |
| [backtest-scale](backtest-scale.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | feat-backtest | #447 | 3a (#434), 3b-i (#444), 3b-ii (#445) all merged 2026-04-19. #447 (3c Full tier) dispatched run-4, structural QC APPROVED, behavioral QC N/A (no strategy behavior change until 3g parity test). Next: 3d (tracer phases) after #447 lands. |
| [support-floor-stops](support-floor-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (PRs #382 primitive + #390 wiring both merged 2026-04-17) |
| [short-side-strategy](short-side-strategy.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#420 merged 2026-04-19). Follow-ups carried to own tracks: bear-window backtest regression, full short cascade, Ch.11 behavioural spot-check. |
| [strategy-wiring](strategy-wiring.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#408 + #409 both merged 2026-04-18) |
| [sector-data](sector-data.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#436 merged 2026-04-19). GHA orchestrator runs continue to consume `trading/test_data/sectors.csv`. |
| [harness](harness.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | harness-maintainer | #448 | #435, #439, #446 all merged 2026-04-19. #448 (T3-A+ sub-item 2: retire inline health-scanner fast scan; fold `dune runtest` + `status_file_integrity.sh` into orchestrator Step 6 deterministic checks) dispatched run-4. Next after #448 lands: T3-A+ sub-item 1 (weekly GHA cron for deep scan). |
| [orchestrator-automation](orchestrator-automation.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-adjacent | — | Phase 1 live (daily cron runs producing summary PRs). Phase 2 (background execution for scrapers, golden re-runs, cross-feature QC) pending empirical tests per status file. |
| [cleanup](cleanup.md) | IN_PROGRESS | code-health | — | Backlog populates from `dev/health/*-deep.md` and `*-fast.md` via lead-orchestrator Step 2e. One dispatch per run, ≤200 LOC, no behavior change. |
| [data-layer](data-layer.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |
| [portfolio-stops](portfolio-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
