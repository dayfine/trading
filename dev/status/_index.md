# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Update when a status file flips
state, an owner changes, or a PR opens / merges / closes. Keep the table
terse; detail belongs in the per-track status files linked in column 1.

Last updated: 2026-04-24 (Tiered-flip merge gate CLOSED. PR #519 merged at 03:42Z — fixes the residual post-#517 bull-crash A/B parity gap. Verified on GHA `tiered-loader-ab` workflow_dispatch run 24870169890: all three broad goldens (bull-crash, covid-recovery, six-year) at PV delta $0.0000 with bit-identical trade lists. Actual root cause was different from the original CreateEntering-timing hypothesis: Summary tier required 52 weekly bars (RS line) before any symbol could promote to Full and seed Bar_history; on the 7-symbol CI fixture this left Bar_history empty for the universe through 2015-01..2018-01. Fix relaxes Full promotion to proceed even when Summary returns None, and the wrapper's Friday cycle now drives Full directly. Next: optional 1-2 confirming nightlies, then flip `loader_strategy` default Legacy→Tiered (~20-line PR).)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

| Track | Status | Owner | Open PR(s) | Next task |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [backtest-infra](backtest-infra.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#419 per-phase tracing merged 2026-04-19) |
| [backtest-scale](backtest-scale.md) | READY_FOR_REVIEW | feat-backtest | #521 (status doc, this PR) | #517 + #519 closed the post-#507 Tiered/Legacy A/B parity gaps. Verified on GHA `tiered-loader-ab` workflow_dispatch (run 24870169890): PV delta $0.0000 on all three broad goldens, trade lists bit-identical. #521 is the doc-only update reflecting #519's actual root cause (Summary tier's 52-weekly-bar RS-window gate, not the CreateEntering-timing hypothesis originally posited). Next: optional 1-2 confirming scheduled nightlies → flip `loader_strategy` default Legacy→Tiered (~20-line PR). 7-symbol CI fixture rebuild remains a separate follow-up tracked in `backtest-scale.md` § Follow-up. |
| [support-floor-stops](support-floor-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (PRs #382 primitive + #390 wiring both merged 2026-04-17) |
| [short-side-strategy](short-side-strategy.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#420 merged 2026-04-19). Follow-ups carried to own tracks: bear-window backtest regression, full short cascade, Ch.11 behavioural spot-check. |
| [strategy-wiring](strategy-wiring.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#408 + #409 both merged 2026-04-18) |
| [sector-data](sector-data.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#436 merged 2026-04-19). GHA orchestrator runs continue to consume `trading/test_data/sectors.csv`. |
| [harness](harness.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-maintainer | — | No open harness PR. Recent merges: #493 POSIX-sh linter, #495 cost-capture new-day fix, #499 cost-capture commit+auto-merge, #504 budget PR creation via curl, #505 budget rescue (all 2026-04-22). Backlog remains saturated — T1 done; T2 milestone-gated; T3-C superseded; T3-H low-priority. Recurring status-file integrity drift from human-merged PRs is a [info] follow-up — linter already exits 1 on violation; requires branch-protection config to enforce. |
| [orchestrator-automation](orchestrator-automation.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-adjacent | — | Phase 1 live (daily cron runs producing summary PRs). Phase 2 (background execution for scrapers, golden re-runs, cross-feature QC) pending empirical tests per status file. |
| [cleanup](cleanup.md) | IN_PROGRESS | code-health | — | Backlog remains empty (no new medium/high findings from latest deep scan or today's fast health check). No code-health dispatch this run. |
| [cost-tracking](cost-tracking.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-maintainer | — | GHA cost capture step landed (#483). Cost-capture new-day bug fixed via #495 + #499 (both 2026-04-22). Next: verify measured `total_cost_usd` now lands correctly on this run's `dev/budget/2026-04-22-run3.json`; compare costs pre/post #481/#482/#495/#499. |

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
