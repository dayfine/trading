# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-08-03 run2 (orchestrator run 30817481526 — main green on `b4b7a3d0`, now `94343ea0`). **Run 2:** queue was EMPTY at start (Step 0.5 fast-exit correctly skipped on the non-empty-queue precondition from #2180), so max dispatch capacity. Writers dispatched **strictly sequentially** per run 1's root cause — no writer collision occurred. #2184 (H-PREV-VERDICT-PIPEFAIL) dispatched → QC NEEDS_REWORK (2/5, two documented claims unpinned, found by mutation testing) → rework iteration 1 → APPROVED 4/5 → **auto-merged `94343ea0`**, all 3 gates green. Also diagnosed #2182's CI failure (two mechanical linter violations, not a design problem) and opened #2185 against its branch to clear them. New findings: `jj`/`jst` are non-functional in GHA (so no agent can open its own PR — REST fallback is the only path); `write_audit.sh` writes audit records `0600` not `0644` (regression from #2169). Shared-tree churn again destroyed orchestrator-owned files mid-run; QC reviews survived only because they were posted to the PR via REST.

Prior (run1, run 30797497236 — main green on `70f6cda9`, then `af19a3ae`). **Stall broken:** #2169 MERGED after 5 days idle — its base commit was already redundant (H-AUDIT-ATOMIC-WRITE had landed via #2163), which is why it was `dirty` and GitHub could not compute a merge ref, so CI never ran; rebased to the N1 pin alone, both QC gates APPROVED 5/5, merged. #2166 also MERGED `22c801e2` after a CP1 rework — both stranded PRs cleared. Root cause of the multi-run stall identified: **parallel agents share ONE working tree in this container** (Step 4's 'branches are independent' claim is false) — they raced, clobbered each other's uncommitted work, and tree-wide `git add` swept foreign files into the index. Also recovered: orphaned branch `feat/picks-slices-bcd` (931 insertions, no PR ever opened) surfaced as #2182, and 4 orphaned budget records. A-FASTEXIT-VACUOUS RESOLVED (#2180).)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
