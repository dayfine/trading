# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Update when a status file flips
state, an owner changes, or a PR opens / merges / closes. Keep the table
terse; detail belongs in the per-track status files linked in column 1.

Last updated: 2026-04-24 (post-#517 reality check: #517 merged but the Tiered-flip merge gate is NOT closed. Manually dispatched `tiered-loader-ab` run 24867554026 shows bull-crash PV delta is identical to the cent ($20709.16) vs pre-#517 — because the CI "broad" fixture is actually 7 symbols, not 1654, so #517's 30-cap removal was a no-op for that scenario. The $20709 drift on 7 symbols is the seed-timing residual the #517 author self-flagged. feat-backtest agent in flight on the seed-timing fix. Two new follow-ups added to `backtest-scale.md`: (1) broad-universe goldens fixture is testing the wrong universe size, (2) reciprocal short-side practical block.)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

| Track | Status | Owner | Open PR(s) | Next task |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [backtest-infra](backtest-infra.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#419 per-phase tracing merged 2026-04-19) |
| [backtest-scale](backtest-scale.md) | IN_PROGRESS | feat-backtest | — (in flight, branch TBD) | #517 merged 2026-04-24 closed the 30-cap part of the post-#507 divergence (small-universe return delta +228pp → +5.7pp) but the manually dispatched `tiered-loader-ab` run 24867554026 shows the broad bull-crash PV delta is identical to the cent ($20709.16) vs pre-fix — same root cause as the residual ~32% trade-count gap the #517 author self-flagged. feat-backtest agent now in flight on the seed-timing fix (`_promote_new_entries` runs after inner picks `CreateEntering`, so on the entry tick inner sees an empty `Bar_history` while Legacy has the full prefix). Also discovered: the CI "broad" fixture is 7 symbols not 1654 (separate follow-up). Next: close seed-timing residual → one clean nightly → flip `loader_strategy` default Legacy→Tiered. |
| [support-floor-stops](support-floor-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (PRs #382 primitive + #390 wiring both merged 2026-04-17) |
| [short-side-strategy](short-side-strategy.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#420 merged 2026-04-19). Follow-ups carried to own tracks: bear-window backtest regression, full short cascade, Ch.11 behavioural spot-check. |
| [strategy-wiring](strategy-wiring.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#408 + #409 both merged 2026-04-18) |
| [sector-data](sector-data.md) | MERGED | — | — | — (#436 merged 2026-04-19). GHA orchestrator runs continue to consume `trading/test_data/sectors.csv`. |
| [harness](harness.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-maintainer | — | No open harness PR. Recent merges: #493 POSIX-sh linter, #495 cost-capture new-day fix, #499 cost-capture commit+auto-merge, #504 budget PR creation via curl, #505 budget rescue (all 2026-04-22). Backlog remains saturated — T1 done; T2 milestone-gated; T3-C superseded; T3-H low-priority. Recurring status-file integrity drift from human-merged PRs is a [info] follow-up — linter already exits 1 on violation; requires branch-protection config to enforce. |
| [orchestrator-automation](orchestrator-automation.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-adjacent | — | Phase 1 live (daily cron runs producing summary PRs). Phase 2 (background execution for scrapers, golden re-runs, cross-feature QC) pending empirical tests per status file. |
| [cleanup](cleanup.md) | IN_PROGRESS | code-health | — | Backlog remains empty (no new medium/high findings from latest deep scan or today's fast health check). No code-health dispatch this run. |
| [cost-tracking](cost-tracking.md) | IN_PROGRESS | harness-maintainer | — | GHA cost capture step landed (#483). Cost-capture new-day bug fixed via #495 + #499 (both 2026-04-22). Next: verify measured `total_cost_usd` now lands correctly on this run's `dev/budget/2026-04-22-run3.json`; compare costs pre/post #481/#482/#495/#499. |
| [data-layer](data-layer.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |
| [portfolio-stops](portfolio-stops.md) | MERGED | — | — | — |

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
