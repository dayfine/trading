# Status Index

Single-source view of all tracked work. Detail belongs in the per-track
status files linked in column 1. Keep every "Next task" cell to one line
(<=160 chars); the `index_size_linter.sh` CI check enforces this.

Last updated: 2026-06-19 (orchestrator run 27851457093 [run 2]: NO-DISPATCH full pass. One new open PR since run 1 — #1659 short-sleeve cash budget (default-off, human `dayfine`, 22:23Z), CI RED solely on `dune build @fmt` (3 of its files unformatted; the "trade #0 differs" is an EXPECTED passing divergence test, not a regression). The maintainer is actively mid-session on exactly this lever — #1658 "next-session levers — reserved short sleeve" self-merged 21:25Z, then #1659 pushed 58 min later — so per gha-local-coordination the orchestrator did NOT race/rework/auto-merge the <25-min-old hot branch; it diagnosed + escalated. QC moot while CI red. Main CI GREEN on HEAD `8065c7d9` (build-and-test + perf-tier1-smoke + both goldens SUCCESS); 0 open ci-red issues. Health CLEAN (status-integrity + index-size exit 0). Nothing else GHA-dispatchable (all feature tracks gated; harness ci.yml fix `[~]` workflow-PAT-blocked; cleanup all `[x]`; ops-data needs EODHD key). 0 subagents. PREVIOUS [run 1] note: NO-DISPATCH full pass. Main advanced `0921c358 → 48e6eb0d` — human (`dayfine`) landed the LOCAL strategy/lens workstream overnight: decision-grading Phase-1 continuation lib #1646, Phase-5 laggard-rotation counterfactual #1653, insurance decomposition #1652, plus the new default-off weekly-close stop axis #1655 (#1654 plan/verdict docs). All squash-merged by the human with green CI; 0 open PRs, 0 open ci-red issues at run time. Main CI GREEN on `48e6eb0d` (build-and-test + perf-tier1-smoke + golden-sp500-5y + golden-custom-universe all SUCCESS). Nothing GHA-dispatchable: every feature track stays data-/human-/LOCAL-gated; harness ci.yml ENOSPC fix still `[~]` (human workflow-PAT-blocked); cleanup backlog all `[x]`; ops-data needs EODHD key (absent in GHA). Health CLEAN (status-integrity + index-size exit 0; deep scan 2026-06-15 0 critical, Action-required NO). 0 subagents.)

## Active + complete tracks

Each row: one line; deeper task detail in the linked status file.
"Next task" = top-of-queue concrete item from that file's Next Steps.

## How to use

- **Find what's in flight**: filter rows by Status = IN_PROGRESS.
- **Find what needs an owner**: look for empty Owner cells on non-MERGED rows.
- **Find what's awaiting review**: check the Open PR column.
- **Find the next concrete task** for a track: read its "Next task" cell.
- **Start a session**: open the linked status file to get full context.

## Maintenance

Agent-owned update: any agent that touches `dev/status/<track>.md`
during a session must also update that track's row here if Status,
Owner, Open PR, or Next task changed. Agents only touch their own row,
so parallel write conflicts stay rare.

The `Next task` cell must be **one line** (<=160 chars). History and
rationale belong in the per-track status file, not here.
`trading/devtools/checks/index_size_linter.sh` enforces the cap at CI.

Orchestrator reconciliation: `lead-orchestrator` diffs this index
against the per-track status files at end-of-run and flags drift.

Adding a new track means creating the status file AND adding a row
here in the same commit.
