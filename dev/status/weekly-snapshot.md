## Status
PLANNED — owner moved to feat-weinstein per #778 scope expansion

Track created 2026-05-02 to absorb M6.1–M6.5 (verification harness via incremental processing). Plan: `dev/plans/m6-weekly-snapshot-verification-2026-05-02.md`. Authority: `docs/design/weinstein-trading-system-v2.md` §7 sub-milestones M6.1–M6.5 (added 2026-05-02).

Per the 2026-05-04 daily summary (#830): M6.1–M6.5 absorbed into feat-weinstein scope; M6.6 live cycle DEFERRED.

## Interface stable
NO — track is brand-new.

The reframe: **weekly picks are first-class durable artifacts before they're inputs to live trading.** This subsystem is a verification harness first; the M6.6 live cycle is wiring on top.

## Blocked on
- None. Prior M5.1 blocker (`split_day_stop_exit:1:post_split_exit_no_orphan_equity`) was RESOLVED by PR #752. Track is owner-pending: feat-weinstein not currently dispatched on M6.x items.

## Scope

### M6.1 — Weekly snapshot generator

`trading/trading/weinstein/snapshot/lib/{weekly_snapshot,snapshot_writer,snapshot_reader}.{ml,mli}` (new). Format: `dev/weekly-picks/<system-version>/<date>.sexp` containing macro context, sector strength, ranked candidates with score/grade/entry/stop/rationale, held positions. Schema-versioned. Round-trip stable.

Wired into `Simulator.step` via gated `--write-snapshots <dir>` flag.

### M6.2 — Forward-trace renderer

`trading/trading/weinstein/snapshot/lib/forward_trace.{ml,mli}` (new). Pure function `(picks, bars, horizon_days) → per-pick outcome`. Reports max favorable, max adverse, final price, stop-trigger, winner/loser. Uses adjusted_close.

CLI: `trace_picks <pick-file> <bars-dir> --horizon 20`.

### M6.3 — Cross-version pick diff

`trading/trading/weinstein/snapshot/lib/pick_diff.{ml,mli}` (new). Set/map operations on parsed snapshots. Reports `added_in_v2`, `removed_in_v2`, score deltas, rank changes, macro_change.

CLI: `diff_picks <v1.sexp> <v2.sexp>`.

### M6.4 — Split/dividend verification harness

EODHD `/splits` + `/div` endpoints (new wiring; data already in plan). Replay 5 known scenarios:

| Symbol | Date | Action |
|---|---|---|
| AAPL | 2020-08-31 | 4:1 forward split |
| TSLA | 2020-08-31 | 5:1 forward split |
| GOOG | 2022-07-18 | 20:1 forward split |
| NVDA | 2024-06-10 | 10:1 forward split |
| KO | 2024 | quarterly cash dividend |

Assertions: adjusted_close round-trip, position quantity post-split, total cost basis preserved, no phantom pick churn, stop-loss adjusted, dividend cash injected for KO.

Wired into `dune runtest` so CI catches G14-class regressions automatically.

### M6.5 — Weekly report renderer

`trading/trading/weinstein/snapshot/lib/report_renderer.{ml,mli}` (new). Pure `Weekly_snapshot.t → string` (markdown). Same shape as eventual M6.6 live report.

CLI: `render_weekly_report <pick-file>` → stdout.

### M6.6 — DEFERRED

Live `DATA_SOURCE` impl, cron wrapper, alert dispatch, trading-state durability. ~5 sessions once verification phase is solid.

## In Progress
- None.

## Next Steps

1. Wait for M5.1 hardening to land (CI green).
2. Open M6.1 PR (snapshot writer + reader + round-trip test) — smallest unblock.
3. M6.2 forward-trace next (pure function, easy to validate).
4. M6.4 split/div verification harness — the highest-value PR for catching G14-class regressions.
5. M6.3 pick diff + M6.5 report renderer in any order after M6.1.

## Parallelism
M6 work runs in parallel with `experiments` track M5.2 — no shared source files.

## Out of scope

- Live data wiring (M6.6).
- Cron / alert dispatch / webhook delivery (M6.6).
- Trading-state persistence across process restart (M6.6).
- Mid-week stop monitor (M6.6).
- Real-time intraday updates — we trade weekly.
