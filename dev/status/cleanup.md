# Status: cleanup

## Last updated: 2026-05-08

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

## Interface stable
NO

Cleanup track has no public interface — it absorbs small mechanical fix-ups surfaced by `health-scanner` (deep + fast scans) so feature agents stay focused on feature work. The "interface" here is the `dev/status/cleanup.md` Backlog schema, which is maintained by the orchestrator and consumed by `code-health`.

## Ownership
`code-health` agent — see `.claude/agents/code-health.md`. Dispatched by `lead-orchestrator` Step 2e on health-scan findings, one finding per dispatch, ≤200 LOC, no behavior change.

## Backlog

- [x] nesting: trading/trading/backtest/optimal/lib/outcome_scorer.ml — extracted _step_stage3, _make_initial_state, _resolve_exit; both violations cleared. PR #950 (2026-05-08)
- [x] nesting: trading/trading/backtest/optimal/lib/optimal_run_artefacts.ml — extracted _rejection_pair_of_alternative + _pairs_of_audit_record; nesting linter clean. PR #949 (2026-05-08)
- [~] nesting: trading/analysis/data/sources/wiki_sp500/lib/ticker_aliases.ml — file avg 2.63 (limit 2.5); deep record literals in all list (source: dispatch 2026-05-07)
- [x] file_length: trading/trading/backtest/lib/result_writer.ml — extracted reconciler CSV writers to reconciler_writer.ml; 372→262 lines (source: dispatch 2026-05-08, branch cleanup/result-writer-split)
- [x] nesting: trading/analysis/scripts/build_snapshots/build_snapshots.ml — extracted 5 helpers (_entry_is_current, _write_and_checksum, _file_metadata, _build_or_log, _load_benchmark_bars, _make_progress, _last_symbol, _fold_symbol); all 78 fns pass nesting linter (branch cleanup/nesting-build-snapshots-2, 2026-05-08)
- [x] nesting: trading/trading/weinstein/strategy/lib/entry_audit_capture.ml — extracted 5 helpers; classify_candidate/emit_entries/alternatives_of_decisions all pass; file avg now under 2.5 (branch cleanup/nesting-entry-audit-capture, 2026-05-08)
- [x] fn_length + magic_numbers: trading/analysis/weinstein/snapshot_runtime/lib/snapshot_bar_views.ml — condensed comments −15 lines (297); restructured to avoid bare literals on mid-comment lines. PR #924 (2026-05-07)
- [x] magic_numbers: multiple files — extract real magic-number constants + fix linter for string-context false positives. PR #955 (2026-05-08)
Orchestrator populates this from `dev/health/<date>-{fast,deep}.md`. Items here are eligible for next dispatch.

## Completed

- [x] fn_length / file_length: weinstein_strategy.ml — added @large-module annotation; file length linter now passes. (source: 2026-04-19-fast.md, PR #453, 2026-04-19)

## Out of scope

- Behavior changes — escalate to the relevant feat-agent.
- Linter rule changes — `harness-maintainer` owns `devtools/checks/`.
- Multi-file refactors crossing module boundaries — feat-agent.

## How findings get here

`lead-orchestrator` Step 2e parses the most recent `dev/health/<date>-deep.md` and `<date>-fast.md`, picks `[medium]` or `[high]` findings (skips `[info]`), and appends one Backlog entry per finding it doesn't already see. The entry shape is:

```
- [ ] <finding type>: <file path> — <one-line context> (source: <date>-deep.md)
```

Subsequent runs may dispatch `code-health` to work the top item; agent flips to `[~]` on start, `[x]` on completion.
