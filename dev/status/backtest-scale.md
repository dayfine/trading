## Blocked on
- PR #396 (plan) reviewed + merged — decisions locked there, including flag-gated rollout with automated parity test as acceptance gate.
- Step 2 tracing (tracked under `backtest-infra.md`) — needed for A/B empiricism on the Legacy vs Tiered cutover.

## Goal

Tier-aware bar loader. Backtest working set scales with actively tracked symbols (~20-200), not inventory (10k+). Today's loader materializes all inventory bars; step 3 introduces three data-shape tiers so Memory budget becomes ~29 MB vs today's >7 GB.

## Scope

See `dev/plans/backtest-scale-optimization-2026-04-17.md` §Step 3 for the full spec. Summary:

1. **Three tiers defined as types, not subsets.**
   - `Metadata.t` — all inventory (~10k) — last_close, sector, cap, 30d_avg_volume
   - `Summary.t` — sector-ranked subset (~2k) — 30w MA, RS line, stage heuristic, ATR
   - `Full.t` — breakout candidates + held positions (~20-200) — complete OHLCV

2. **`Bar_loader` module** with `promote : t -> symbols:string list -> to_:tier -> t`. Screener cascade calls promote as symbols advance through stages. Demotion on exit/liquidation frees Full-tier memory.

3. **Runner flag `loader_strategy = Legacy | Tiered`.** Default `Legacy` at merge time. Acceptance gate = parity test on golden-small scenario (diffs trade count / total P&L / final portfolio value / each pinned metric within float ε). Merge blocked until parity holds.

4. **Post-merge ramp:** flip default to `Tiered` in a tiny follow-up PR after a few weeks; retire `Legacy` in the one after.

## Scope boundary

Do NOT touch in this track:
- Strategy, screener cascade logic (orchestrate calls, don't rewrite)
- Incremental indicators (separate axis; likely unnecessary once tiers cut the 10k loop)
- Parallel backtest workers (orthogonal)

Build alongside existing `Bar_history` — don't modify it.

- Engineering design: `docs/design/eng-design-4-simulation-tuning.md` — note that tier-aware loading is a pragmatic optimization over the design, not a change to the DATA_SOURCE abstraction
- Prerequisite: `backtest-infra.md` step 2 (tracing) must land first

## Size estimate

~500-800 lines total. Split across 2-3 commits:
- Bar_loader types + Metadata/Summary loaders (~200 LOC)
- Full tier + promotion logic (~200 LOC)
- Runner integration + screener cascade wiring (~200-300 LOC)
- Tests + parity acceptance gate (~100 LOC)

## QC

overall_qc: PENDING
structural_qc: PENDING
behavioral_qc: PENDING

Reviewers when work lands:
- qc-structural — module boundaries between tiers; `Bar_history` untouched; parity test runs both strategies.
- qc-behavioral — does strategy output (trades, metrics) actually match Legacy within ε? Any regression is a behavior bug, not a perf win.
